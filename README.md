Twitter is used as our master node as it is mainly text based. Using nltk we are able to remove stop words and extract the important context of the tweet. we will then use the Youtube search API to get 20 videos based on the context and take the top 3 videos based on views.

Another layer of search is done to on the highest viewed video of the previous layer to check for more videos. It will then be added to the current 3 videos which will result in 5 videos where we will take the top 3 most viewed videos. This will allow us to obtain a more contextual storyline.
